Personal Website of Aditya Prakash: [LeibTon](prakashaditya369.github.io)  
Aditya Prakash is a student of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Kanpur and expects to be graduated by June 2023.  

## Tools and Techniques used.

- Used HTML5 and CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
- Used anime.JS and GreenSock JS for animation.
- Used Canvas for interaction. Examples: LeibTon in [homepage](https://prakashaditya369.github.io), Image Effect in [About Me](https://prakashaditya369.github.io/about.html) page.

## Sitemap:

- [Homepage](prakashaditya369.github.io): The site's Homepage has a Canvas used to display **LEIBTON**, which you can interact with. Then a summary about me. After that, there is a section containing all my projects information serving as my portfolio.

- [About Me](prakashaditya369.github.io/about.html): Everything you need to know about me. This page contains a Canvas to provide the image effects [*For fun, try dragging the image*].

- [Say Hi](prakashaditya369.github.io/contact.html): All my contact details. I tried to present it in an interactive way.

- [Blogs](prakashaditya369.github.io/blog.html): This page contains links to Medium posts I write.
- [What I am doing now](prakashaditya369.github.io/now.html): I am trying to summarise everything going on in my life at present in one page.

## Things I am proud of about my site:

I designed every aspect of my site the way I wanted it to be. But these are some of the best ones I am proud of:

- [Navigation Menu]: The navigation menu in the top right corner of the Homepage appears like a bubble changing its shape. When you click on it, four bubbles appear from it, presenting links to other pages.

- [Image Effect in About Me Page]: The particle effect used for the image is another fascinating thing I learnt. Especially the dragging effect of the image is my favourite.

- [Browser in Project section of Homepage]: To present all my websites, I used long screenshots of webpage. I designed using CSS, which I particularly love a lot.

- [Theme of Blog Page]: It's pleasant.

- [Now Page]: Well, I like this page, in general, because it's dynamic (keeps changing with my life).


#### Thanks.
