      The boyo has started his American adventure. Everything seems fine here. Great flatmates, great lab, great supervisor and man, A LOT OF STUDIES. Seems settling well in Atlanta for my PhD at Georgia Tech. Let's see where it goes. Hoping to make some more friends and get well in Atlanta. Btw it's a crazy fucking place. As my friend Abirath said, "GTA in Real Life".
