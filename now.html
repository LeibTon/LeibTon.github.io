      This year is coming to its end. It has been a year with ups and downs. Pretty bad and pretty good.
       Got the opportunity to go to Japan, work under the best professor in the field of space robotics. 
       Made coolest space friends there. And what not? Tried Ramen, yummy yummy! Man, I am missing it right now? 
       Travelled Japan to its fullest, the best place in the world for living other than a little bit of introvertness.
        It is among the best moments of my life. 
        Other than this, got involved in the project deeper, finalising building the experimental setup, 
        hopefully I will be able to start my experiment next year. Life is good. Big news, got placed at NMtronics. 
        I mean, I was hoping to do a PhD. But an excellent offer came for research in robotics. PhD hunt has been very productive. 
        I got to know about so many research in the field. Found my interest in spacecraft autonomy. Let's see what happens.
      Got close with my friends, family, everyone is happy, the world is happy. And your boy fell in love :)))
