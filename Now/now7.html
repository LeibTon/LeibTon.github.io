    <h2>Previous Semester</h2>
    <p>
      A long time since we last talked. Completed 5th semester and loved some of the courses a lot. <strong>Psychology
        of Well-being</strong> proved to be a very helpful which I think should be made institute compulsory.
      <strong>Optimal Spaceflight Control</strong>, <strong>Compressible Aerodynamics</strong> and <strong>Introduction
        to Aerospace Structures</strong> proved to be interesting and important for my future endeavour. <strong>Flight
        Mechanics</strong> was mostly based on Aeroplanes so can't say much but it introduced me to analysis of control
      and stability of a system. And I had taken <strong>High Energy Physics of Binary Star System</strong> just to get
      feel of Physics which I felt heavely¿
    </p>
    <h2>The Good Teacher</h2>
    <p>
      So, after the end of 5th semester, I planned to work on <strong>The Good Teacher</strong>. It is a project to use
      Deep Learning model to learn concepts and then use the model to classify educational resources available on
      internet to present make the resources more accessible and useful. I had spent a lot of time thinking about the
      model and I am just close to finding the perfect one. I couldn't give much time to this project because of social
      commitments and will continue working with 2nd priority in the next semester.
      <br />
      I am also currently working on my research topic: A general framework for solving invere kinematics problem using
      Neural Networks. It's done but am busy perfecting the model. Will surely take remaining days of December.

    <h2>Next Semester</h2>
    <p>
      Hopefully, the next semester is going to be on campus. I hope so. The rising cases of Omicron is a great concern
      and I fear everyday that I will not be able to go to campus. This fear is the worst. So, I took a lot of courses
      next semester. It's gonna be good. The courses are based on Rocket Propulsion, advanced course on Compressible
      Aerodynamics, Turbelence, Control (Real one) and Mathematics (another experiment). Can check the list of courses
      here: <a href="https://prakashaditya369.github.io/coursework.html">Coursework</a>.
