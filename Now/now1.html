<h2>Busy in my first online Sem</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking of what I am busy with nowadays, I would say academics. I am a second-year student in Aerospace Engineering, and I need to study to get a degree. So yeah, I am busy attending online lectures, submitting assignments, taking quizzes, and hoping for an offline semester. Enjoying my favorite courses (Yeah, there are some courses I am really into and paying attention to) and just surviving in courses I don't like (Not so many, but yeah, there are some). With the hope to make some friends, I am also into some clubs and societies. I am not sure if this is serving its purpose (possibly due to online mode or maybe my shy nature), but I am learning something (I am not sure what I am learning, but I hope I got something about this in the future). I wish I am right to think I am living a healthy college life.</p>
<h2>Searching for meaning in life</h2>
<p>I am into that phase of life when we enter into the real world, and with this comes the question: Do I really matter? I am busy searching for an answer to this question. I am not sure if I can explain how I am searching, but I am really into it.</p>
<h2>Expanding my interests</h2>
<p>When you enter your college life, you explore too many things. I am in my second year, and I am still exploring. I have a massive bag of interests, and I am still unsure if I should stop expanding and start sorting. I am currently into Web development, like I developed five websites in the last three months. (Too slow, huh. Hey, don't forget my academics). Also, I am into Deep Learning and Cognitive Psychology. Too many things to do (you must be a busy person). Not that busy, I am living my to the fullest.</p>
<h2>Living my life</h2>
<p>Till now, you would have made an image of a nerd in your mind. But wait, I am not just a book-boy. I am also busy finishing the list of movies my friends keep me recommending (sometimes google too), and this list keeps expanding. So this is never going to stop.<br /> You know the only advantage of online sem is: Mamma's food. And I am enjoying it a lot. This is all what "Living my life" means for me, and I enjoy it a lot.</p>
<p>This is all that I am doing now, studying, making sites, watching movies, searching for meaning (sometimes), eating, and sleeping.</p>
