    <h2>Another Online Semester</h2>
    <p>Hurray! I completed my first online semester. Grade remained same but studied a lot. Well hard work paid off and
      I learnt a lot too. As I said, there are always some courses you like. I got 4. But got 'A' grade only in 2. Fine
      in one course, I fucked up and in other one, others did well. Let past semester be past. So yeah! New semster. I
      am excited and prepared. Gonna study more. Well No! Just gonna be smart. Hope to find some favorite courses too
      this semester. I have just completed my winter break. I didn't do anything related to academic, so will discuss
      about it in some other section. <br />
      There is another thing going in my college life other academics. You can't guess it. It's IITK family. I expanded
      my IITK family. I got some bachchas(first-years). Am I confusing you? [Read about it on Quora or <a
        href="/contact.html">ask me</a>.] Having a good time with them, hope they are also having a good time. That's
      all about my college life.</p>
    <h2>Searching for meaning in life</h2>
    <p>I am still in that phase of life when we enter into the real world. So yeah, I am still searching for questions
      that I told you earlier. I got some answer, but that's still complex. Will tell you when it gets simpler. Amidst
      my search, I watched Mr Robot in my winter break. A Masterpiece! A Must Watch! It redefined the meaning of society
      for me to some extent. Wanna change the society[world], but it's quite rigid. Need a strong purpose. Will get one
      soon.</p>
    <h2>Expanding my interests</h2>
    <p>Still expanding but slowly because of academics. Have a strong attraction toward Web Development. I modifed <a
        href="https://projectekatra.me">Project Ekatra</a>to a great extent. Made a algorithm <a
        href="prakashaditya369.github.io/visualizer">visualizer</a>. Other than this, I also have got a lot of interest
      in Aerospace Engineering particularly Spaceship. [Hope to get a career in it. Making spaceships like Ford made
      cars.] Deep Learning is going fine. Just revising concepts. Cognitive World is what my brain is. Started exploring
      open-source. Just contributed my first pull request and I think there is no coming back from open source now. Got
      another thing to do in my free time. I have some new courses this semester. Hope to get some new interests soon.
    </p>
    <h2>Living my life</h2>
    <p>I wouldn't say this, this time. My routine has got messed up. But still I get to eat my favourite: <em>Gajar Ka
        Halwa</em> once a week. Completed Mr Robot and currently watching Hannibal. I am dreaming 8 hours. So yeah! I am
      still enjoying.</p>
    <p>This is all that I am doing now, studying, making sites, watching series, searching for meaning (sometimes),
      eating, and sleeping.</p>
