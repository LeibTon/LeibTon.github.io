So, where am I, at what stage of my life? I don't know. I have seen enough, I have been through enough. Life is nothing more than whtat I say, I really don't know. But what are we? God knws? No, nobody knows? What makes us humane is all the experiencces in the world. Every person is a different story, consequences of so many things. We are not animals, we don't just born, eat, sleep, fuck and die. We tend to live. We live every second of our life. That mekes us different.
But what is the meaning of all this? That's the point of it. There is no singularity in anything. There is no singular thing, no purpose, no definition. You live to live. How you deine it depends on you. My friend suggested, "We live to maximise our happinsess". I kinda agree. Live the life you want to have. Wanna dance, dance. Wanna say hello, say hello. Don't hesitate, don't think case you don't think how to live. Do live, experience it all. Don't just survive and then die.

And here I am, experiencing it all. Travelling worlds, living different experiences. What do you want? What I call life. IDK. I am confused. matbe I will never know. Just trying to find stuff. May be I found it.
I live to idk, do stuff. Watch a movie, smile at people, see people smiling, roam around, watch people enjoying life, work on space projects. But I do think a lot, trying to not thinking on how to live but to live to think.
Thinking how to build a spacecraft cause that's how I live. I live to think not think how to live. Enough of this aftermath of watching movie bullshit. But yeah, I think I am at the stage of breaking this illusion of idk some kinda barrier. Get my real self. Enjoy the life as it is meant to be. 
Love is all there is.
