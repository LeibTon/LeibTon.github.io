    <h2>One More Semester Gone</h2>
    <p>
     A pretty long time since we last talked. One more semester has gone. Well, it was a good semester; partially because of offline classes and partially because of interesting courses. No more comments.

    <h2>Frederiction</h2>
    <p>
      Well, this is all present is all about. I am currently interning at UNB, Frederiction, Canada. I am working on Robotic Manipulator trying to control it in a "nice" way. It is a very nice place. Everything is perfect here but sometimes scary because of less population. You can wonder the entire campus in day without finding a single person.
    </p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
     I am working on multiple things at a time. Let's see what happens.
